# Price Comparison

# About
The project stored in main.py utilizes the power of the Selenium framework to perform web scraping of restaurant food items prices and delivery fees from three different food services: Doordash, Uber Eats, and Skip the Dishes. 

The primary objective of this project is to provide users with a more convenient and time-efficient way of comparing restaurant prices and delivery fees across multiple food services. By extracting data directly from each platform's website, this project allows users to easily compare prices and fees, saving users' time and effort. 

Overall, this Python-based project aims to simplify the process of ordering food online by providing a reliable and easy-to-use tool for comparing prices and delivery fees across multiple popular food service.

As there are no available APIs for these delivery services, I used Selenium, a popular web automation tool, to automate the web scraping process.

# To note:
- As it would be time consuming and a hassle for users to enter credentials on these 3 different delivery service sites the extracted delivery prices are what one would see from a regular account without being Premium. Doordash offers $0 delivery fee for first time orders hence I could only produce it. 
- Temporary Special offers provided to regular customers are also not considered.
- Restaurant's need to be open for delivery.
